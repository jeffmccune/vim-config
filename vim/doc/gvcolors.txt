1. Usage							*gvcolors*
>
        :GVColors
<
    This command will open a new tab and display all the colors available
    under X by displaying their names in their own colors (in four columns).
    The status line will show decimal versions of the associated
    red:green:blue colors of the line currently displayed at the top.

    <leftmouse>  will bring the selected color to the top screen line
    <rightmouse> will toggle between dark and light colored background.

    If you attempt to show more than 188 colors using vim v6.3, the additional
    colors will be set to Ignore highlighting.  The reason is that vim 6.3 and
    earlier has a limit on the number of highlighting colors it can handle at
    one time.

2. History						*gvcolors-history*

v7 05/20/08 : * :GVColors introduced (before, the file had to be opened and
                 sourced)
v6 07/15/04 : * allows rightmouse to click between dark & bright backgrounds
                (earlier versions only allowed shift-leftmouse)
              * double-click with leftmouse will pull the color line up
                to the top of the screen, thereby displaying its rgb values
              * <gvcolors.vim> is now folded
              * version 7 now supports 1000s of highlighting groups;
                gvcolors takes advantage of that
   10/10/07   * Looks in some more places for where the rgb.txt file may be.
                Please remember that you can always "tell" gvcolors where
                rgb.txt is by setting gvcolors_rgbtxtfile to its path.
